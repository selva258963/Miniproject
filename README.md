## Title of the Project
NutriMate: A Comprehensive System for Food Calorie Detection, BMI Calculation, and Personalized Calorie Recommendations

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
NutriMate is a data-driven, web-based application designed to assist users in managing their health through food calorie detection, BMI calculation, and personalized calorie recommendations. 
By leveraging data science techniques and deep learning, the system estimates calories from food , calculates BMI to assess health status, and provides customized calorie suggestions based on user inputs. 
NutriMate empowers users to make informed dietary choices and achieve their fitness goals through advanced data analysis.


## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Calorie & Macro Calculation: Calculates calories, carbs, protein, and fats based on user-input food item and quantity, sourced from a JSON-based nutritional dataset.
- BMI Calculation & Status: Provides BMI values along with categorized health status (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, or obese).
- Personalized Caloric Recommendations: Calculates daily caloric needs based on user weight, height, age, gender, activity level, and fitness goal (maintain, gain, or lose weight).
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple, intuitive design allowing easy input and access to personalized health insight
